            <div class="row-2"><p class="p4">We are a Chicago based company. We started with the focus of making cultural exploration possible wherever we are.</p> 

                <p class="p4">We are committed to global diversity and awareness. More specifically we want to facilitate the opportunity for everyone to engage in experiences from various cultures that collectively represent the people of the USA.</p>
                
                <p class="p4">We want people to be able to travel internationally right here in their cities in the USA and experience a different culture without having to get on a plane… We also want it to be easier for people to share their events and communities with others who may not normally have access.</p>

Even though I’m not a marketing major, I’ve always been interested in learning more about it. I believe combining my PR skills with my new marketing skills will help the team and myself reach our goals for our projects. When I’m not working I love to workout, go to concerts, and hangout with friends. Plus, I love trying different foods from other cultures and learning information I never knew before.</p>
